    <h1>Terms of Use and Booking Agreement</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date: December 11, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>
    IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE COMPLETING YOUR BOOKING.
    BY ACCESSING OR USING THE LOLAELO PLATFORM OR COMPLETING A BOOKING, YOU AGREE TO
    BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.
  </p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Use ("Terms") are a binding agreement between you ("Guest", "you", "your")
    and Lolaelo Travel Technologies Inc. ("Lolaelo", "we", "us", "our") governing your access to
    and use of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the Lolaelo website, applications, checkout pages and online services (the "Platform"); and</li>
    <li>the lodging accommodations, activities, excursions, transportation, rentals and add-on services listed on the Platform ("Travel Services").</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Lolaelo is a digital marketplace and booking facilitator. We do not own, operate, manage or control
    any hotel, accommodation or activity provider listed on the Platform. Each Travel Service is provided
    by an independent service provider.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Nature of the Platform</h2>

  <p>
    Lolaelo enables independent hotels, homestays, hostels, villa owners, tour operators, guides, activity vendors
    and other providers (collectively, "Service Providers") to list Travel Services for booking. When you complete
    a booking, you enter into a separate and direct contract with the Service Provider. Lolaelo is not a party to
    that contract.
  </p>

  <p>Lolaelo’s responsibilities are limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>providing technology to discover and book Travel Services,</li>
    <li>transmitting booking information between you and the Service Provider, and</li>
    <li>collecting payment on behalf of Service Providers when applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Service Providers alone are responsible for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the safety, legality and performance of their Travel Services,</li>
    <li>the accuracy of descriptions, photos, rates, policies, taxes and availability,</li>
    <li>compliance with all local laws, permits and regulatory requirements, and</li>
    <li>all claims, damages, costs and liabilities arising from those services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Guest Eligibility and Representations</h2>

  <p>By using the Platform you confirm that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>you are at least 18 years old and legally able to enter contracts,</li>
    <li>the information you provide is accurate, complete and current,</li>
    <li>you will comply with all rules and instructions of Service Providers,</li>
    <li>you will not engage in fraudulent, speculative or abusive activity, and</li>
    <li>you will ensure all members of your party comply with these Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Activities, Add-ons and Known Risks</h2>

  <p>
    Activities, excursions, tours, transportation and add-on services ("Add-ons") may involve inherent risks, including
    but not limited to injury, illness, accidents, drowning, weather hazards, wildlife interactions and equipment failure.
    By participating, you acknowledge and voluntarily assume all such risks for yourself and any minors in your care.
  </p>

  <p>Service Providers are solely responsible for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>staffing, supervision and training,</li>
    <li>equipment maintenance and safety protocols,</li>
    <li>obtaining and maintaining required licenses, permits and insurance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Lolaelo does not guarantee the safety, quality or suitability of any Travel Service or Add-on. To the fullest extent
    permitted by law, we do not accept liability for injuries, accidents, illnesses, property damage or other losses arising
    from Travel Services or the acts or omissions of Service Providers.
  </p>

  <p>Any claim or dispute relating to an activity, excursion or Add-on is strictly between you and the Service Provider.</p>

  <h2>4. Booking, Confirmation and Contract Formation</h2>

  <p>
    A booking is confirmed only when you receive a Lolaelo confirmation, either on screen or by email. Availability is
    not guaranteed until a booking is confirmed. Once confirmed, the booking forms a binding contract between you and the
    Service Provider and is subject to that provider’s policies, which are shown at or before checkout.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Prices, Fees and Payments</h2>

  <p>
    Prices shown on the Platform are set by Service Providers and may include taxes, fees and other charges.
    Lolaelo may charge a platform or processing fee, which will be disclosed during checkout.
  </p>

  <p>
    By submitting payment, you authorize Lolaelo to charge your chosen payment method on behalf of the Service Provider.
    Once Lolaelo collects payment, your payment obligation to the Service Provider for that booking is satisfied.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lolaelo is not responsible for currency exchange differences, foreign transaction fees or bank and payment processor charges.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Cancellations, Modifications and Refunds</h2>

  <p>
    Each Service Provider defines its own cancellation, modification, no-show and refund policies. These policies are
    presented to you during checkout and become part of your agreement with the Service Provider.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some bookings may be non-refundable, partially refundable, non-changeable or subject to penalties. Lolaelo does not
    provide refunds beyond what the Service Provider’s policy allows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Service Providers may cancel bookings due to operational needs, safety concerns, weather, overbooking or force majeure.
    Any refunds in such cases are determined by the Service Provider’s policy.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Guest Conduct and Property Rules</h2>

  <p>During your stay or activity you agree to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>follow all house rules, posted policies and instructions,</li>
    <li>maintain respectful behavior toward staff and other guests,</li>
    <li>avoid damage to property, equipment and facilities,</li>
    <li>comply with occupancy limits and safety guidelines.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Service Providers may refuse service, evict guests or charge additional fees for rule violations, damage or misconduct.
    Lolaelo is not responsible for decisions or actions taken by Service Providers in these situations.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Platform Content and Accuracy</h2>

  <p>
    Photos, descriptions, amenity lists, facility details, prices and promotional content are provided by Service Providers.
    Lolaelo does not guarantee that this content is accurate, complete or current. We may correct obvious errors, including
    pricing or availability mistakes, at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Liability Disclaimer and Limitations</h2>

  <p><strong>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</strong></p>

  <p>
    Lolaelo is not liable for injury, death, illness, accidents, property damage, theft, loss, delay, interruption,
    misrepresentation, dissatisfaction or any other claim arising out of or related to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>your use of the Platform,</li>
    <li>the acts, omissions or negligence of any Service Provider or third party,</li>
    <li>any Travel Service, activity, excursion or Add-on,</li>
    <li>unsafe conditions, equipment failure or lack of maintenance,</li>
    <li>acts of God, weather, natural events, government actions or force majeure events,</li>
    <li>disputes between you and any Service Provider or third party.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Lolaelo is not a guarantor or insurer of guest safety, regulatory compliance or service quality.
    In all cases, Lolaelo’s total aggregate liability to you is limited to the lesser of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the total amount you paid through the Platform for the booking at issue, or</li>
    <li>USD $200.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You waive any claim against Lolaelo arising from reliance on Service Provider content, participation in risky activities,
    transportation provided by third parties or negligence or misconduct by local vendors.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>

  <p>
    You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lolaelo and its officers, employees, contractors,
    founders and affiliates from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable
    legal fees) arising out of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>your use of the Platform,</li>
    <li>your participation in any Travel Service or activity,</li>
    <li>your violation of these Terms or of applicable laws, or</li>
    <li>actions or omissions of any person in your booking party.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Disputes</h2>

  <p>
    Disputes concerning a Travel Service, including quality or delivery of the service, must be resolved directly between
    you and the Service Provider. Lolaelo may assist with communication but is not obligated to mediate or resolve such disputes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Platform are governed by the laws of the State
    of Delaware, USA, without regard to conflict of law rules.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and share personal data. By using the Platform you also agree to
    the practices described in the Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Amendments</h2>

  <p>
    Lolaelo may update these Terms from time to time. The version in effect at the time of your booking governs that transaction.
    Continued use of the Platform after changes take effect constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>14. Severability</h2>

  <p>
    If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force
    and effect.
  </p>
